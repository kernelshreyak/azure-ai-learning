    "Before we start, there are certain steps we need to take to deploy the models:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Register for a valid Azure account with subscription \n",
    "* Make sure you have access to [Azure AI Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/what-is-ai-studio?tabs=home)\n",

    "\n",
    "    > Notice that some models may not be available in all the regions in Azure AI and Azure Machine Learning. On those cases, you can create a workspace or project in the region where the models are available and then consume it with a connection from a different one. To learn more about using connections see [Consume models with connections](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/deployments-connections)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Deploy with \"Pay-as-you-go\"\n",

      "**Data preprocessing**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Collect a large dataset of historical stock prices for the stock you're interested in, covering at least 18 years.\n",
      "2. Preprocess the data by:\n",
      "\t* Handling missing values or irregularly spaced data.\n",
      "\t* Normalizing the data (e.g., scaling or standardizing) to ensure features have similar magnitudes.\n",
      "\t* Extracting relevant features from the data, such as:\n",
      "\t\t+ Moving averages (e.g., 50-day, 100-day).\n",
      "\t\t+ Relative strength index (RSI).\n",
      "\t\t+ Bollinger Bands.\n",
      "\t\t+ Volume indicators (e.g., On Balance Volume).\n",
      "\t\t+ Other technical indicators you think might be relevant.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Feature engineering**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Design a set of features that capture the relationships between the stock price and other variables, such as:\n",
      "\t* Historical returns or profits.\n",
      "\t* Market sentiment (e.g., using sentiment analysis on social media or news articles).\n",
      "\t* Economic indicators (e.g., GDP, inflation rate, interest rates).\n",
      "\t* Seasonal patterns or holidays.\n",
      "2. Use techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) or t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) to reduce the dimensionality of your feature set, if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Machine learning model selection and training**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Choose a suitable machine learning model for this problem, such as:\n",
      "\t* Neural Networks (e.g., LSTM, GRU) for time series forecasting.\n",
      "\t* Random Forest or Gradient Boosting for classification or regression.\n",
      "\t* Support Vector Machines (SVM) for binary classification.\n",
      "2. Split your dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 70% for training and 30% for testing).\n",
      "3. Train your model on the training set, tuning hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or cross-validation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Predictive modeling**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Use your trained model to predict the future stock price or returns.\n",
      "2. Generate buy/sell signals based on the predicted price differences or returns.\n",
      "3. Evaluate the performance of your model using metrics like:\n",
